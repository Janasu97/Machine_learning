# Machine_learning
This repository contains some of the Machine Learning projects realized durig Computer Science studies.
Lab 3 - Simple Neural Network that predicts the class of iris plant basing on its parameters. The NN contains two hidden layers, fully conected with RELu activation function. Output layer is using softmax function.
Lab 5 - Fully connected autoencoder for classification of MNIST dataset.
Lab 6 - Convolutional Neural Network for classification of MNIST dataset.
Lab 7 - Examples of classification using kNN, SVM, linear and logistic regression.
Lab 8 - Task realized with self created dataset containing 10000 records of strings of length 15 over the alphabet with only a, b, c, d letters. Half of the dataset contains regex-matching parts.
